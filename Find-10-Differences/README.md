In this advanced tutorial in Python and OpenCV, we'll explore how to find differences in similar images. 
We'll start by taking an original image that contains two similar images and use OpenCV Canny and Findcontours functions to extract the two images out of the original. 
<br/><br/> 
Then, we'll subtract the images from one another and use HSV masking and OpenCV bitwise_and function to create a new image with the differences. 
We'll use Canny, Dilate and Findcontours to capture and mark those differences, displaying them on our original image. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to detect changes in similar images using OpenCV and Python.
<br/><br/> 
This tutorial is ideal for intermediate to advanced users of OpenCV and Python who want to take their image processing and computer vision skills to the next level.ed!
