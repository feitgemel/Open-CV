In this tutorial, we'll show you how to detect moving objects using Python and OpenCV. Specifically, we'll walk you through the process of taking a video file of moving cars, extracting each frame, and detecting the cars in each frame using a combination of OpenCV functions like createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2, threshold, erode, dilate, and contours. We'll also show you how to mark the detected cars with rectangles and text, so you can easily see where they are in the frame.
<br/><br/> 
We'll start by preprocessing the video frames to extract only the moving pixels, and then use contours to detect the cars in the frame. We'll also show you how to mark the cars with bounding boxes and labels, so you can easily see which cars are moving and where they are in the video
