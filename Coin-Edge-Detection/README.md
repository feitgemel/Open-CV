Are you interested in learning how to detect and count coins in an image using Python and OpenCV? Look no further! In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of using image processing techniques to identify coins in an image, sort them by size, and mark each coin with a corresponding number.
<br/><br/> 
We'll start by converting the image to grayscale and applying a blur to help filter out noise. Then, we'll use the Canny function to detect edges and find contours around each of the coins. After sorting the detected areas, we'll loop through each one and display a circle around or inside it.
<br/><br/> 
This tutorial is perfect for beginners looking to learn more about image processing with Python and OpenCV. By the end of this video, you'll have a solid understanding of how to detect and count coins in an image and apply these techniques to your own projects. So grab your favorite beverage, sit back, and let's get started!
