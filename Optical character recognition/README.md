In this tutorial, you'll learn how to extract text from images using Python OpenCV and EasyOCR. Whether you're working with scanned documents, images of signs, or any other image with printed text, this video will show you how to use these powerful Python libraries to automatically detect and extract the text.
<br/><br/> 
We'll start by loading an image with printed text and displaying it in Python. Then, we'll use EasyOCR to detect the text in the image and extract it for further processing. You'll also learn how to set a scoring threshold to only extract text with a certain level of confidence, and how to draw a rectangle around the extracted text to highlight it in the original image.
<br/><br/> 
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use Python OpenCV and EasyOCR for text detection and extraction, and you'll be able to apply these skills to your own projects. Whether you're interested in building an OCR system, automating text extraction tasks, or just exploring the possibilities of computer vision, this video is a great place to start.
