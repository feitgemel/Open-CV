In this Python tutorial, you'll learn how to run an Atari 2600 Grandprix game and use computer vision and OpenCV to detect the cars in the game. 

You'll also learn how to manipulate the car using keyboard commands to avoid obstacles and create a self-driving car program using Python. 

This tutorial is perfect for anyone interested in computer vision, retro game development, or artificial intelligence.
