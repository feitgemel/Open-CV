Have you ever wanted to extract individual words from scanned book pages, but weren't sure how to do it? In this video tutorial, we'll show you how to use Python and OpenCV to perform word segmentation on scanned book pages, allowing you to easily extract words and use them in your own projects. 
<br/><br/> 
We'll start by converting the image to grayscale and applying thresholding to enhance the contrast between the text and the page background. Then, we'll use OpenCV functions to detect the lines of text and sort them by their position on the page. From there, we'll zoom in on each line and repeat the process to detect individual words. Finally, we'll store the words in an array along with their corresponding coordinates, making it easy to display any word on the page by selecting the corresponding item in the array. 
<br/><br/> 
Whether you're working on a digital library project or just want to extract text from scanned documents, this tutorial will give you the tools you need to succeed. So join us as we explore the exciting world of word segmentation with Python and OpenCV!
