Do you remember playing "Where's Wally?" as a kid? 
What if you could take that game to the next level using advanced computer vision techniques?
<br/><br/> 
Our latest tutorial shows you how to find Wally in any image using Python and OpenCV. 
We'll take an image of Wally and use it as a template to search for matches in larger images. 
<br/><br/> 
This involves using OpenCV functions and learning how to look for a specific image area based on another image. 
<br/><br/>
